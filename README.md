# PredictTheKick

This project is designed to build an ML model to get soccer ball trajectory predictions for penalty kicks in XY dimensions

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Setup and Running Code

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:


1. **Open Google Colab**: Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.


2. **Upload the Notebook**: Click on `File` > `Upload notebook` to upload a `.ipynb` file from your computer.


3. **Connecting to a Runtime**: To execute the code, you need to connect to a runtime:
    - Click on `Connect` at the top right corner of the window.
    - Choose either a hosted runtime or connect to a local runtime if necessary.


4. **Running the Code**: You can run the code by clicking on the play button (`▶️`) next to each code cell or use `Runtime` > `Run all` to execute all cells in sequence.
